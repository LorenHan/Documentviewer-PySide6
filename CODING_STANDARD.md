# PySide6 Document Viewer Coding Standards

The coding standards are maintained separately for Chinese and English readers. Please consult the version that fits your workflow:

- [中文版规范 / Chinese Standard (v2.0)](./CODING_STANDARD_CN.md)
- [English Standard (v2.0)](./CODING_STANDARD_EN.md)

Both documents are kept in sync and reference the Qt Coding Style as the baseline.
